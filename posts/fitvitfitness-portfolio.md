Website: [FitVit](https://fitvitfitness.com/)

An interesting site I launched in December of 2022 called FitVit which stands for 'Fitness and Vitality'. I developed the site with a personal trainer named Chris Daoud, providing fitness workout programs and information.

I liked building this site as fitness has been one of my passionate hobbies in recent years. I was excited about developing this project with Chris Daoud, who is also passionate about fitness. He's much more experienced, knowleagable than I am and persued a trainer certification. If your curious about Chris check him out [here](https://fitvitfitness.com/about/).

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of the site is for Chris to provide tips and workout programs to help people keeping in shape especially with busy lifestyles. People tend to lose motivation easily as they don't want to live at the gym or havng a costly membership. The pandemic has also affected people where and how they train as they use less gym facilities.

We started with the site  providing fitness information that Chris wants to build a community on and the near future a mobile app is in the plan to be released which will allow users to track their workout progress from on their device.

## 2. Framework Stack

FitVit is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the framework which I have experience in the past with React.js.

My goal was to have FitVit as a static site. One feature needed was a blog section about fitness articles and workout programs to the users. Next.js provided an easy way to integrate using Markdown (MDX) as each file is generated as static page.

Basically each blog post is a simple webpage static page which is not rendered by the server or using some database to store the article.

 deployed to Firebase for hosting. Generating static web pages is much more performat as the pages are serverd from a CDN network which make loading times much quicker.

## 3. Role of the Project

My role of the project was 100% focused developing the site from the ground up.

First I planned & designed the mockups using Figma and then discussing with Chris if the UX made sense and what doesn't

## Final Thoughts

As you see this the blogging site has been developed and started but eventually a mobile app will be developed helping user keep track of their workouts
