Website: [FitVit](https://fitvitfitness.com/)

A site launched in December of 2022 called FitVit which stands for 'Fitness and Vitality'. I developed the site with a personal trainer named Chris Daoud, providing fitness workout programs and tips.

Fitness has been one of my passionate hobbies in recent years was excited to develop this project with Chris, who is also passionate about fitness. He's much more experienced, knowleagable than I am which he persued a trainer certification. If your curious about Chris check him out [here](https://fitvitfitness.com/about/).

## Overview & Goal

The goal of the site is to provide tips and workout programs to help people staying fit especially with busy lifestyles. People tend to lose motivation as they don't want to live at the gym or havng a costly membership but want a healthy lifestyle. The pandemic has affected people where and how they train as less gym facilities being used. This is our opinion and what Chris has been seeing. People want to stay fit by providing information and easier ways of training which can keep them motivated or even an easy way to start.

Eventually, in the future, a mobile app will be developed which will allow users to track their workout progress from their own device.

## My Role of the Project

I was the solo developer and created the site from the ground up.

I began designing the desktop & mobile mockups using Figma. Coming up with a color scheme and designing UI elements This is usually my first step getting all the UI layouts organised, so I have a clear vision how to architect the components with pixel perfect styling.

Once that was done, I selected the proper framework and began developing the actual components and archtecture of the website. I won't get into all the technical details but will describe below which framework I used.

## Web Framework Stack

I decided to develop the site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is based on React.js. I do have knowlegeable experience and worked with React.js in the past in previous companies. React.js allows you to easily create resuable components through the site for example the header section, footer section and buttons etc.

My goal was to have this site as a static page website with a blog section. Next.js provided an easy way to integrate using Markdown (MDX) as each file is generated as a static page which is not rendered by the server or using some database to store the article.

Performance was taken into consideration as static web pages are much more performant and important for SEO purposes. Static websites can be served from a CDN server which load times are faster and Firebase hosting provides this solution. Other cloud services do provide this solution but Firebase is one platform that offers other services which is needed in the future, for example, Firestore and Authentication.

As mentioned above Next.js framework also takes SEO practices into account, helping you implement SEO technical requirements.

## Conclusion

So here is a quick run down of tech stack and tools I used:

- Figma
- React.js
- CSS (not sass)
- HTML & Javascript (of course! I don't think it should be mentioned)
- GitHub with CI Deployments using Actions
- Firebase Hosting

We are currenlty in the progress of creating more blog articles and adding more content. Also making SEO technical impprovments and keeping eye on Google Analytics and watch traffic grow over time. A newsletter section will be created using Mailchimp storing all future client emails that Chris wants to manage.

Will keep you updated in the future for more improvements and features. Thanks for reading!
