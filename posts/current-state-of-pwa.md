The web is an incrediable free platform helping developers solve problems for users and providing tools for the web. PWAs in particular are driving the web even furthur to be a better platform

Actually PWAs are not a new concept. Steve Jobs first introduced the concept of Progressive Web Apps back in 2007. Google eventually refined the name as 'Progressive Web Apps' and enbraced the technology very well but iSO not as I will get to it

## What is a Progressive Web App exactly?
Here's an article from web.dev [What are Progressive Web Apps?](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/)

> "Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are built and enhanced with modern APIs to deliver enhanced capabilities, reliability, and installability while reaching anyone, anywhere, on any device with a single codebase."

In a nutshell allows web apps to open up as it's own standalone app giving that native mobile or app experience. For a PWA web app it just requires a manifest and service worker file. By adding these files you allow the app to be installable. 

When the user visits your web app the browser will provide a installable notification prompt. If they accept an icon will be added on the homescreen just like a native app. PWAs embraces features like

 - WebRTC (Video Chat)
 - Geolocation
 - Push notifications 
 - Access hardware connected via USB, serial port, or bluetooth
 - Interact with data stored on your device, such as contacts and calendar events
 - Reduced size of app

## 1. Any companies using the PWA?

Of course! Here are some of the companies are developing PWAs apps like Instagram, Uber, Starbucks, Twitter, Spotify, Pinterest, Tinder and Amazon. Twitter has seen some increase in the activity for example:
> "65% increase in pages per session, 75% more Tweets, and a 20% decrease in bounce rate, all while reducing the size of their app by over 97%"

## 2. Is it Supported All Browsers or Devices

Unfortuntaly no! IOS has compatiablity issues. Here are some important list of features that iOS is lacking:

- Push Notifications
- Installable Prompt
- Loading Current State

In my opinion these are the key features that makes apps even better. Every app needs mobile notification which allow users to engage to your app. IOS annouced they will be releasing this feature in 2023.

Without an installable prompt how will your users know how to install the web app and take advantage of the PWA features?

This was an issue i came across where user will lose current state and 

## 3. Why even bother?
