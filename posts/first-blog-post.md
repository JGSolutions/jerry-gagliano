I always had web developer portfolio site of myself. Allowing recruters or companies a quick way to access my resume. But never focused on it much as I was always busy with work or with some side project. 

It's been always in the back of my head "Do it! You need to do this!". For me a basic portfolio site was always boring not motivating to keep up-to-date as it's difficult to get traffic or attraction. As time went by, looking at my old site and got disgusted by it then i decided "ok fine let's do this!" but a blog is needed. Then was thinking "I' m a horrible writer but a good writer for coding :/" This is when I needed to get out of my comfort zone.

Here are some valid reasons that motivated me to start this blog and I hope this can help you too as developer or any other type of career your in.

## JamStack (Next.js)

These days static websites and cloud environments are the buzz words.

## SEO

SEO as a developer is a good skill to pick on because it can help you drive organic traffic from search engines on personal projects you may have. I did take a quick course and got a certificate on HubSpot that learned a few tips. Now I need to website to actually try the concepts I learned and see how it works.
