I always had a web developer portfolio site. Allowing recruiters or companies a quick way to access my resume. But I never focused on it much as I was always busy with work or some side project.

It's been always in the back of my head to create a blog. For me a basic portfolio site was always boring not motivating, not knowing what content to write up and most importantly keeping up-to-date. As time went by, looking at my old site and got fustrated by it. By no means I am no professional writer but an opportunity to get out of my comfort zone and try something different.

Here are some valid reasons that motivated me to start this blog and I hope this can help you too as developer or any other type of career your in.

## 1. Next.js

As a developer always curious to trying new frameworks and this was my chance. Ten years ago creating a static site was not as flexable as today especially with a blog. Probably WordPress was the best solution to generate dynamic pages. But now with frontend frameworks generating static pages I can have my code base all componentized with React.js and build all static pages. If your into blogging or just need to create static websites for your clients Next.js or even Nuxt.js are the frameworks to check out. Will actually blog more about this topic in the near future.

## 2. SEO

SEO as a developer is a good skill to pick up on as it can help you drive organic traffic from search engines on your personal projects or even offer it as a freelance service. I did a course and got a certificate on HubSpot. My goal is to actually to try these concepts that I learned and this is the opportunity to drive traffic to my blog.

## 3. Sharing my Experiences

The most important reason is to share what I learned and provide tips about the web. Not all blogs will be technical but also general topics about the web that can help regular people or businesses in general.

To finish I hope in the future my blog can help other people and provide valid information. My goal is keeping past blogs up-to-date when versions of frameworks, libraries or patterns are released. Another key is keeping my blog posts simple, short and sweet.

Happy coding!
