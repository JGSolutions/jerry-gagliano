I previously wrote an blog [4 Reasons Why Developers or Designers Should Have a Blog](https://jgsolutions.ca/posts/why-developers-need-to-blog/). It provides some tips and motivation for developers or designers to start blogging. The main question we ask ourselves when starting a new blog is should we create your own blog or use an existing blog platform like Medium or Dev.to? 

I recently came across an interesting article [Why you should NOT code your own blog when starting out blogging](https://tuomokankaanpaa.com/blog/why-you-should-not-code-your-own-blog-when-starting-blogging) Take a quick read before you continue reading. The blog does provide valid points but still I'm not 100% convinced.

## Helps You Learn a New Web Stack

This is a perfect opportunity to learn a new web framework or improve your CSS, HTML and Javascript skills. Especially if your a freelancer or creating side projects. There are several JS frameworks that can get you started quickly for example: Next.js, Nuxt.js or Astro.

In my situation I when decided to redo my porfolio and a blog, I decided to go with Next.js. As I do have some React.js experience. Next.js provided a quick way to implement a blog using Markdown and generate static pages for SEO purposes.

Speaking of SEO another great skill to learn. Once you have your site structured and coded, helps you learn some SEO techniques. Having your own blog will be flexiable to change any SEO technical requirements to help you rank your blog better. This is a whole other topic which I won't get into.   

## Helps You Be Creative

Your a developer or designer and we love creating things. We have the skill and power to create anything we want on the web. Designing does occupy most of the developer's time. Planning your designs properly before coding keeps you challenged and learn new design skills. 

In the meantime you will probably learn new design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD. In my opinion Figma is the best tool as it's free and easy to use. I actually designed this blog, portfolio and other various projects myself using Figma.
## 3. Invest in Your Blog

If your serious about blogging invest in your platform and make it unqiue. When landing on a Medium blog it doesn't seem unique. As if the author tried out Medium by writing a blog to see what will occur especially it's the only blog since 2018. Then readers get distracted, navigate to other related blogs.

If readers are not subscribers for a specific blogging platform like Medium they provide a maximun of articles per month. If they reached the limit, your blog will be missed. Also think about what happens if your articles eventually get traffic? What if Medium decides to shutdown? How to transfer all articles to another blog or eventually you decide you want my own blog.

Most of the known developers or designers have their own unique blogging platform. Here are some examples:

- [Chrome Develoeprs](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/)
- [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev/)
- [Paul Kinlan](https://paul.kinlan.me/)
- [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/)

## Final Thoughts

Overall yes it seems more work and you might not be able to write blogs right away until your blog is setup. In the meantime you can always write down some topics and objectives for these topics in google docs as your developing your blog. Once your blog is deployed, copy, paste the ideas, and begin releasing articles.
