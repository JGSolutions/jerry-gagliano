I previously wrote an blog [4 Reasons Why Developers or Designers Should Have a Blog](https://jgsolutions.ca/posts/why-developers-need-to-blog/). It provides some points or motivation for developers or designers. The question is should a developer bother creating it from scratch? 

So recently I came across an interesting article [Why you should NOT code your own blog when starting out blogging](https://tuomokankaanpaa.com/blog/why-you-should-not-code-your-own-blog-when-starting-blogging) Take a quick read before you continue my article. The blog does provide valid points but still not 100%.

## 1. Your a Developer and Should be Creative

## 2. Helps You Learn a New Stack

## 3. Makes You Invest

## Final Thoughts

var add2 = function(number) {
  return number + 2;
}
