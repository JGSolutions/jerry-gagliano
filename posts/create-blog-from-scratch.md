I previously wrote an blog [4 Reasons Why Developers or Designers Should Have a Blog](https://jgsolutions.ca/posts/why-developers-need-to-blog/). It provides some tips and motivation for developers or designers to start blogging. The main question we always have when starting a new project is should you create your own blog from scratch or just use an existing blog platform like Medium or Dev.to? 

So recently I came across an interesting article [Why you should NOT code your own blog when starting out blogging](https://tuomokankaanpaa.com/blog/why-you-should-not-code-your-own-blog-when-starting-blogging) Take a quick read before you continue reading. The blog does provide valid points but still I'm not 100% convinced.


## Helps You Learn a New Web Stack

This is a perfect opportunity to learn a new web framework or improve your CSS, HTML and Javascript skills. Especially if your a freelancer or creating side projects. You don't have to go crazy and build a framework from the ground up but they're several JS frameworks that can get you started quickly for example: Next.js, Nuxt.js or Astro.

In my situation I when decided to redo my porfolio and a blog, I went with Next.js. Next.js provided a quick way to implement a blog using Markdown and generate static pages for SEO purposes. Implementing HTML and JS code wasn't time consuming. It's usually the design that is time consuming. It might be the opposite for other developers or designers.

Speaking of SEO another great skill to learn. Once you have your site structured and coded, helps you learn some SEO techniques. Having your own blog will be flexiable to change any SEO technical requirements to help you rank your blog better. This is a whole other topic which I won't get into.   

## Helps You Be Creative

Your a developer or designer and we love creating things. We have the skill and power to create anything we want on the web. As I mentioned above designing usually consumes most of the time than actually coding. This can help you be more creative for other future projects that you might do. Other tools you will probably learn are Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD.

In my opinion Figma is the best tool as it's free and easy to use. I actually designed this blog and portfolio myself using Figma.
## 3. Invest in Your Blog

If your serious about blogging invest in your platform and make it unqiue. When landing on some Medium blog it doesn't seem serious to me. It seems the author tried out Medium by throwing out a blog to see what will occur especially if they written the only blog back in 2018. 

If readers are not subscribers for a specific blogging platform like Medium they have a maximun of articles they can read per month. If they reached the limit, your blog will be missed. Think about what happens if your articles eventually get traffic? What if Medium decides to shutdown? How to transfer all articles to another blog or eventually you decide I want my own blog.

Most of the known developers or designers have their own unique blogging platform. Here are some examples:

- [Chrome Develoeprs](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/)
- [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev/)
- [Paul Kinlan](https://paul.kinlan.me/)
- [Addy Osmani](https://addyosmani.com/)

If you invest in your own platform you will be set for the long run.
## Final Thoughts

Overall yes it seems more work and you might not be able to write blogs right away until your blog is setup. In the meantime you can write down some topic ideas and objectives in google docs as your developing your blog. When the first version of your blog is deployed, copy, paste the ideas, and being releasing articles. This is how I did it.
