I recently came across an article, [Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/). 
Interesting article about criticising single page applications and Javascript being evil. I agree and disagree with
certain points. Again I will be pointing fingers at ReactJS.

This blog is targeted for people or business owners who are not deevlopers but looking for some key tips to be careful for there next web project

    ## What is SPA?
</div>

SPA stands for (single page application)! Here is a quick description from Wikipedia.

> "A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app. "

> "In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions."

A clear explanation if more info needed?

<div id="learn-html">
    ## Learn Basics of HTML, CSS, JS First
</div>

As mentioned in the article, Meta (Facebook) marketed the library in a particular way where developers went away created a bunch of
components. The community is great and components are abundant but are heavily dependant on Javascript.

ReactJS uses JSX, which kinda looks like HTML, but it’s not really HTML because it’s a mix of HTML with component tags and fake attributes. A ReactJS
developer will learn and use className to add a specific style class but in the real HTMl world it's just call 'class'!

Actually I even wrote an article about why we should choose [Web Components Over ReactJS](https://jgsolutions.ca/posts/reactjs-vs-web-components/). Web
components are more native to the browser and might require less Javascript depending how complexity of the component. But JSX is 100% javascript that needs
to be rendered and executed.

For all developers, please learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript first! Don't jump into ReactJS and be convinced that ReactJS is the way to go! 

For business owners be careful what kind of freelance developer you choose for your website. If you think ReactJS developer is the right way,
you might run into suprises that can costly heavily in the long run.

<div id="when">
    ## When To Use SPAs?
</div>

The question that you might have is 'When do we use SPAs?' If your developing a complex web application which requires users to authenticate, SPAs can be the right strategy to use. Users will instantly get the views
and data that they need when they navigate through the app. It will provide a basically a native web app experience. 

Examples of web apps based on single page application:

- gmail
- Google Analytics
- Twitter
- Figma


But if you ecommernce, blog or basic business website. Going blindy and develop the site in ReactJS with a SPA architecture is JUST WRONG!

These sites need to be fully rendered with proper
HTML document. When view sourcing the page (by right clicking and select view source) you should see a fully html document rendered.

## Advantages of SPA Architecture

Giving the user mobile UX experience. Views or section switch quickly providing the information the user needs

## DisAdvantage of SPA 

SPAs are not SEO friendly. When the app is loaded the content is injected using Javascript. When you view source, the code between your body
tag will probably contain some empty htmll elements with Javascript.

When search engines crawls the site they can't execute Javascript and 

## Not SEO friendly

## Performance
The article mentions about performance issues with SPAs. How the initial loading of Javascript on the frontend can slow down the loading
times. Which is 100% correct! There are ways to overcome this problem by loading the javascipt that is needed only

Talk about Graph QL. How executing code should be on the server

## Should You Use ReactJS?




## Conclusion
I strongly believe SPAs still has its place. We should continue to use this strategy in web development, which can push the
web platform to its limits.
 
For myself, I' m a big fan on SPAs and one of the main reasons I became a front-end developer through my career. 
I love the technical complexity that comes with developing SPAs as it's heavy development on Javascript which requires
good programming knowledge. But as a developer we need to be smart when to use SPA architecture which can ruin a user's UX experience.
