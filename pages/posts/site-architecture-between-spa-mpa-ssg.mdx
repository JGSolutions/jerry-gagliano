I recently came across an article about [Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/). 

As I am a big fan os SPAs and one of the main reasons for me becoming more a front-end developer. I love develop SPA applications as there is more 
complexity I do agree on certain points that the author mentions but some I totally disagree. SPAs has its place and need to be smart when to use this
development strategy


## Conclusion


export default ({ children }) => <BlogLayout meta={meta['site-architecture-between-spa-mpa-ssg']}>{children}</BlogLayout>
