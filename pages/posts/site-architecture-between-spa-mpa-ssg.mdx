I recently came across an article, [Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/). 
Interesting article about criticising single page applications and Javascript being evil. I agree and disagree with
certain points. Again I will be pointing fingers at ReactJS.

This blog is targeted for people or business owners who are not deevlopers but looking for some key tips to be careful for there next web project

Overview topics I will be discussing about

- [What is SPAs](#what-spa)
- [Learn HTML First](#learn-html)
- [When To Create Single Page Website](#when)
- [Don't use Single Page Pattern](#user-content-low-row)

    ## What is SPA?
</div>

SPA stands for (single page application)! Here is a quick description from Wikipedia.

> "A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app. "

> "In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions."

A clear explanation if more info needed?

<div id="learn-html">
    ## Learn HTML, CSS, JS First!
</div>

As mentioned in the article, Meta (Facebook) marketed the library in a particular way where developers went crazy  and created 
a bunch of components. The community is great and components are abundant but are heavily dependant on Javascript.

ReactJS uses JSX, which kinda looks like HTML, but it’s not really HTML because it’s a mix of HTML with component tags and fake attributes. A ReactJS
developer will learn and use className to add a specific style class but in the real HTMl world it's just call 'class'!

Actually, I wrote an article about why we should choose [Web Components Over ReactJS](https://jgsolutions.ca/posts/reactjs-vs-web-components/). Web
components are more native to the browser and require less Javascript depending how complexity of the component. But JSX is 100% javascript that needs
to be rendered and executed.

For all developers, I recommend to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript first! Don't jump in the bag wagon with ReactJS 
and build simple sites as single page app! 

For business owners be careful when choosing a freelance developer for your website. If you think ReactJS is the right way,
you might run into suprises that can costly heavily in the long run.

<div id="when">
    ## When To Use SPAs?
</div>

The question your probably asking yourself is 'When do we use SPAs?' 

Simple! If your developing a complex web application or some tool which requires users to authenticate. Examples of web apps based on single page application:

- Gmail
- Google Analytics
- Twitter
- Figma
- Google Maps
- Netflix

On the otherhand, if your developing an ecommerce, blog or basic business website, then stick with the traditional way of serving
websites from the server or use a static server generator frameworks. I will explain more of this in the SEO section.

## Advantages of SPA Architecture

Users will instantly get the view and data renderd as they navigate across a SPA, providing a
a native mobile app experience.

Hosting SPAs are just static files like CSS, JS and HTML that can be hosted in serverless cloud

- All resources loaded initially

## Not SEO Friendly 

One huge disadvantage of SPAs, they are not SEO friendly. Usually SPAs content are rendered within the browser using Javascript.
Google search engine crawlers can't execute and crawl that particular content properly. By manually viewing source the code from the browser, the body
tag usually contains some empty div HTML elements and the views are injected in those elements. Since routing is not native the search engines can't 
crawl throughout the other pages. 

If SEO is not that important and your web app and authentication is needed, then don't worry about it. Think of it this way, would it be neccessary for 
search engines crawling your Gmail or Netflix account? Probably not!


## Performance
The article mentions about performance issues with SPAs. How the initial loading of Javascript on the frontend can slow down the loading
times. Which is 100% correct! There are ways to overcome this problem by loading the javascipt that is needed only

Talk about Graph QL. How executing code should be on the server

I gotten good scores with lighthouse. Yes you might get some critial warnings and have to workaround it but it's possible.

## Should You Use ReactJS?

Not saying you need to completely ditch ReactJS. Developers have to be more clever how it's used! Don't go crazy and develop components all over your site and loading kilobytes of Javascript through the network! 
If your in love with ReactJS and really needs to be used, there are frameworks like Next.js, Astro that help you manage ReactJS. 



## Conclusion
I strongly believe SPAs still has its place. We should continue to use this strategy in web development, which can push the
web platform to its limits.
 
For myself, I' m a big fan on SPAs and one of the main reasons I became a front-end developer through my career. 
I love the technical complexity that comes with developing SPAs as it's heavy development on Javascript which requires
good programming knowledge. But as a developer we need to be smart when to use SPA architecture which can ruin a user's UX experience.
