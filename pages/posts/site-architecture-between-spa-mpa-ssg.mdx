I recently came across an article, [Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/2023/single-page-applications-criticism/). 
Interesting article about criticising single page applications and Javascript being evil. I agree and disagree with
certain points.

## What is SPA?

SPA stands for (single page application)! Here is a quick description from Wikipedia.

> "A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app. "

> "In a SPA, a page refresh never occurs; instead, all necessary HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code is either retrieved by the browser with a single page load,[1] or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions."

Not clear enough?

## When To Use SPAs?

As mentioned in the article Meta (Facebook) marketed the library in a particular way where developers can go ahead and develop
components. Actually I even wrote an article about why we should choose [Web Components Over ReactJS](https://jgsolutions.ca/posts/reactjs-vs-web-components/)

Going blindy and develop you whole site in ReactJS with a SPA architecture is JUST WRONG!

Basically any type of ecommernce, blog or business website. These sites need to be fully rendered with proper
HTML document. When view sourcing the page (by right clicking and select view source) you should see a fully html document rendered.

If your developing a complex web application which requires users to authenticate, SPAs can be the right strategy to use. Users will instantly get the views
and data that they need when they navigate through the app. It will provide a basically a native web app experience

## Advantages of SPA Architecture

Giving the user mobile UX experience. Views or section switch quickly providing the information the user needs

## DisAdvantage of SPA 

SPAs are not SEO friendly. When the app is loaded the content is injected using Javascript. When you view source, the code between your body
tag will probably contain some empty htmll elements with Javascript.

When search engines crawls the site they can't execute Javascript and 

## Performance

The article mentions about performance issues with SPAs. How the initial loading of Javascript on the frontend can slow down the loading
times. Which is 100% correct! There are ways to overcome this problem by loading the javascipt that is needed only
## Should You Use ReactJS?

## Not SEO friendly


## Conclusion
I strongly believe SPAs still has its place. We should continue to use this strategy in web development, which can push the
web platform to its limits.
 
For myself, I' m a big fan on SPAs and one of the main reasons I became a front-end developer through my career. 
I love the technical complexity that comes with developing SPAs as it's heavy development on Javascript which requires
good programming knowledge. But as a developer we need to be smart when to use SPA architecture which can ruin a user's UX experience.
