Always a debate between using React.js vs Web Componnents and of course more people favour React.js and bigger community
using React.js
Since 2012ish React.js has gain attraction in the web development world. At the same time, Google released Polymer library 
which was web components but not 100% compatiable with all browsers as it needed a polyfill library. Not too many companies were
adapting to Plyomer


<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
        // Express.js route
        app.post("/subscribe-newsletter", subscribeNewsletter);
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
