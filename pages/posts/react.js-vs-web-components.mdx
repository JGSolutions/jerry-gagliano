The big discussion between React.js vs Web Componnents. I will talk about how Web Components are catching up and dev should working with Web Components more towards
the future.

Since 2013ish Facebook released React.js, which has gain attraction in the web development community. Around the same time, Google also 
released Polymer a library based on web components but required polyfills which browser support was very minimal.

Of course, React.js was compatiblele for all browsers, developers were able to ship products much quicker and easier. The community grew as libraries and tools
were popping up, making developer's lives easier.

Now fast forward 10 years or more, Web Components has caught up with the web standards and works natively in all browsers Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge.

## Light Weight

To run web components, no extra library is needed to run components on the browser. With React.js have 3 layers of code that needs to run.

1. Your custom React component
2. The actual react.js library to run your components
3. The browser to actually render all the elements

On top of the React.js is 100% javascipt based which needs to be bundled and loaded.


## Adnostic

All your web components you create can used in any web framework, Angular, Svelt, React.js, Next.js etc.

## Encapsulate the CSS

## Slot
<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
        // Express.js route
        app.post("/subscribe-newsletter", subscribeNewsletter);
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
