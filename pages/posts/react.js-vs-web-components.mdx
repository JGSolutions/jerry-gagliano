There always be a debate between React.js vs Web Componnents. They both have pros and cons and serve a purpuse but web components have improved and tend to have 
an advantage over React.js.

Since 2013ish Facebook released React.js, which has gain attraction in the web development community. Around the same time, Google also 
released Polymer a library based on web components but required polyfills which browser support was very minimal.

Of course, React.js was compatible for all browsers, developers were able to ship products much quicker and easier. The community grew as libraries and tools
were popping up, making developer's lives easier.

Fast forward 10 years or more, Web Components has caught up with the web standards and works natively in all browsers Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge. So why should we start using it?

## Light Weight

To run web components, no extra library is needed to run components on the browser. 
With React.js, there are 3 layers of code that needs to run.

1. Your custom React component.
2. The React.js library to run your components.
3. The browser to actually render all the elements.

## Agnostic

Web components can be imported and used in any web framework, Angular, Svelt, React.js, Next.js etc. Most companies are using web components for creating UI Kits
that can be used in any type of project. One example of this is Ionic. As there UI can be used in Angular, React.js or Svelt and of course basic HTML projects.

## Styles are Encapsulated

All the stylings for that component are encapsulated in that component. Meaning any css in your project with the same style class name can not overwite
the components styles. Other developers don't need to worry about styling and just need to worry about what attributes need to used.

React.js is possible but other 3rd party packages need to be installed. Instead web components provides this feature out of the box.

## Slot

This one feature that shines over React.js, as you can provide your components with child elements. The problem is what if you want to provide mulitpule 
child elements in your component in different elements. For example you have a title and sub title. 
Having mulitpule child elements for each is the way to go but React is not possbile unless you pass each on as props.

With Web components you can sepecify a section with a name and using SLOTS and point at which element you want to use. Here is an example:

In you component template will contain this.
<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
       <p>
        <slot name="my-title">main title will go here</slot>
        <slot name="my-subtitle">sub title will go here</slot>
       </p>
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
      <my-header>
        <span slot="my-title">Main title</span>
        <span slot="my-subtitle">Sub title</span>
      </my-header>
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>


## Conclusion

As you can see, web components have come a long way and growing in populartity. Developers should begin embrace them
as it will push the web to it's limits.

Currently React.js is used in alot of projects but Web components will take over and leave React.js they way the web left JQuery behind. When 
begining a new prject think about the future not what library is trending.
