Always a debate between two great web technologies using ReactJS or Web Components. The journey that Web Components have grown, it's a great time 
to discuss the key features of how web components can be beneficial in your next or future projects.

## A Brief History of Both Web Technologies

In 2013 Facebook released ReactJS, which has gained attraction in the web development community. ReactJS was compatible with all browsers, 
was developed to simplify the process of building web applications. The community grew as libraries, tools, design patterns
were released, making developers' lives easier.

Around the same time, Google released Polymer. A web components library that required a polyfill whose browser support was very minimal.

Fast forward 10 years or more, Web Components has caught up with the web standards and works natively in all browsers Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge. 

Here is a great video how to create a web component.

## Light Weight & Fast

To run web components, no extra library is needed to run components on the browser. Just import the module
to your project and use it as a regular html element. Web components run natively on the browser as suppose to ReactJS requires
a javascript library to be imported.

With ReactJS, an extra layer of code needs to be executed. ReactJS does not work with Real DOMs. Instead, 
it has a Virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the Real DOMs in JavaScript.

## Agnostic

Web components can be imported and used in any web framework, Angular, Svelte, ReactJS, Vue, and Next.js. More companies are beginning
to use web components for creating UI kits that can be imported into any project or framework. 

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) is one example using Web Components in their UI kit components. The previous versions, UI components were all based on 
Angular modules which were strictly made for Angular apps. Eventually, in later versions, all the UI components switched to Web Components which opened up the doors for developers like
ReactJS, Vue and native JavaScript apps.

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is another framework allows developers to easily integrate web components in the framework easily to build simple sites and CMS.

If all your components or app architecture is based ReactJS then your stuck with ReactJS unless you convert all your components.

## Styles are Encapsulated

Web components use Shadow DOM. All styles for that component are encapsulated in that component. Any CSS in your project with the same style class name will not overwrite
the components styles. This allows developers the need not to worry about styling and debugging issues that might come up.

ReactJS does not have shadow dom. There are other alternatives 3rd party packages are needed to be installed.

## Slots

One feature that shines over ReactJS, is as you can provide web components with multiple child elements. 
In ReactJS you can't provide multiple child elements in your component. 
For example, if you have two elements title and sub-title sections. In ReactJS this is not possible unless you 
pass each item as a prop.

In Web components, you can specify different sections with a name with using <mark>slot</mark> and point at which element you want to use. Here's an example:

Inside your Web Component template will contain this.  
<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
      // A header component
       <p>
        <slot name="my-title">main title will go here</slot>
        <slot name="my-subtitle">sub title will go here</slot>
       </p>
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Imported and calling the component you can add elements as child elements.  
<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
      <my-header>
        <span slot="my-title">Main title</span>
        <span slot="my-subtitle">Sub title</span>
      </my-header>
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Development Tools

Communities such as Google have released tools and libraries to help speed up productivity and enhance Web Components. 
This allows developers continue to develop on their existing framework and use the syntax that they're comfortable with. 
These tools or libraries will compile the source code into native web components.

List of tools and libraries that allows you to do this.

- [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements) (Google)
- [StencilJs](https://stenciljs.com/) (Ionic)
- [Lit](https://lit.dev/) (Google)

## Conclusion

As you can see, web components have come a long way and growing in popularity. Developers should begin to embrace them
as it will push the web to its limits.

I feel eventually the rate that Web components are heading, will take over ReactJS and leave it behind they way the JavaScript left JQuery.
