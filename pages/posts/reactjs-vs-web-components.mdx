There are great quantity of key features of how web components can be beneficial in your next or
future projects. They both have pros and cons that serve a purpose but web components have improved and heading
in the right direction over ReactJS.

## A Brief History of Both Web Technologies

In 2013 Facebook released ReactJS, which has gained attraction in the web development community. ReactJS was compatible with all browsers, 
was developed to simplify the process of building web applications. The community grew as libraries and tools
were popping up, making developers' lives easier.

Around the same time, Google released Polymer. A web components library that required a polyfill whose browser support was very minimal.

Fast forward 10 years or more, Web Components has caught up with the web standards and works natively in all browsers Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge. 

Here is a great video how to create a web component.

## Light Weight & Fast

To run web components, no extra library is needed to run components on the browser. Just import the module
to your project and use it as a regular html element. Web components run natively on the browser as suppose to React.js requires
a javascript library to be imported.

With ReactJS, an extra layer of code needs to be executed. ReactJS does not work with Real DOMs. Instead, 
it has a Virtual DOM, a lightweight representation of the Real DOMs in JavaScript.

## Agnostic

Web components can be imported and used in any web framework, Angular, Svelte, ReactJS, Vue, Next.js etc. Companies are beginning
to use web components for creating UI kits that can be imported in any project or framework. 

[Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/) is one example using Web Components in their UI kit components. The previous versions, UI components were all based on 
Angular modules which were strictly made for Angular apps. Eventually in later versions all the UI components switched to Web Components which opened up the doors for developers like
ReactJS, Vue and native JavaScript apps.

[Astro](https://astro.build/) is another framework allows developers to easily integrate web components in the framework easily to build simple sites and CMS.
 
## Styles are Encapsulated

Web components use shadow DOM. Basically all styles for that component are encapsulated in that component. Any css in your project with the same style class name will not overwite
the components styles. This allows developers the need not to worry about styling and debugging issues that might come up.

ReactJS does not have shadow dom. There are other alternatives wiith 3rd party packages are needed to be installed.

## Slots

One feature that shines over ReactJS, as you can provide web components with multiple child elements. 
The problem in ReactJS you can't provide multiple child elements in your component. 
For example if you have two elements title and sub title sections. In ReactJS this is not possible unless you 
pass each item as prop.

With Web components you can specify different sections with a name and using <mark>slots</mark> and point at which element you want to use. Here's an example:

Inside you Web Component template will contain this.  
<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
      // A header component
       <p>
        <slot name="my-title">main title will go here</slot>
        <slot name="my-subtitle">sub title will go here</slot>
       </p>
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Imported and calling the component you can add elements as child elements.  
<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
    {`
      <my-header>
        <span slot="my-title">Main title</span>
        <span slot="my-subtitle">Sub title</span>
      </my-header>
    `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Development Tools

Communities such as Google have released tools and libraries to help speed up productivity and enhancing Web Components. 
This allow developers continue to use their existing framework and develop the syntax that they're comfortable with. 
Which then the framework or library will compile the source code into web components.

List of tools and libraries that allows you to do this.

- [Angular Elements](https://angular.io/guide/elements) (Google)
- [StencilJs](https://stenciljs.com/) (Ionic)
- [Lit](https://lit.dev/) (Google)

## Conclusion

As you can see, web components have come a long way and growing in populartity. Developers should begin embracing them
as it will push the web to it's limits.

Currently ReactJS is used in alot of projects but Web components will take over and leave ReactJS they way the web left JQuery behind. When 
begining a new prject think about the future not what library is trending.
